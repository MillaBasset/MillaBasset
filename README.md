# Hello! I'm Milla. Welcome to my GitHub page.

## About Me

I am a 20 year old student at the University of Maryland - College Park, born on April 30th.  
I am a Computer Science and Math dual major, with a general focus in the areas of:

- Cybersecurity
- Game development
- General utility and tool design

As for games, I play literally anything, for any console, including PC. However, I have a list of favorites:

- Tetris and other block stackers
- 4-key rhythm games (usually Etterna)
- Freedom Planet (and any other GalaxyTrail game)
- Anything on the Nintendo Switch

If you want to reach me, I'm usually available to chat on Discord (millabasset).

## Where is Cambridge?

In an effort to promote continued development for the project, it has been moved to [its own organization](https://github.com/cambridge-stacker).  
Please do not e-mail or otherwise message me for support with the project. All questions should be redirected to the [Cambridge Discord](https://discord.gg/AADZUmgsph).

### To Employers

All my contributions to the Cambridge project are located at the repositories contained within the organization.  
I believe this project to be a sufficient representation of my skills. Please e-mail me with any further questions you may have.

## Thanks for visiting my page! There will be more to come soon...
