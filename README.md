# Hello! I'm Milla. Welcome to my GitHub page.

## About Me

I am a 19 year old student at the University of Maryland - College Park, born on April 30th.  
I am a Computer Science and Math dual major, with a general focus in the areas of:

- Cybersecurity
- Game development
- General utility and tool design

As for games, I play literally anything, for any console, including PC. However, I have a list of favorites:

- Tetris and other block stackers
- 4-key rhythm games (usually Etterna)
- Freedom Planet (and any other GalaxyTrail game)
- Anything on the Nintendo Switch

If you want to reach me, I'm usually available to chat on Discord (Milla#5642).

## Where is Cambridge?

Cambridge is currently discontinued for the time being as I have felt for a while that I lack the motivation and energy to maintain the repository.  
Please check out [Tetro48's fork](https://github.com/Tetro48/cambridge) of the engine, although I will offer no support on how to use it.  
**To employers:** My version of Cambridge is available upon request.

## Thanks for visiting my page! There will be more to come soon...
