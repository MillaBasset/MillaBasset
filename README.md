## Hello! I'm SashLilac, a.k.a. SpinTriple.

But enough of that...

## About Me

I just love cybersecurity. I'm 16, and trying to major in it.

All pronouns, so people don't have to ask me about it.

As for games, I play literally anything, for any console, including PC. However, I have a list of favorites:

- Tetris (including official games and clones)
- Freedom Planet (and any other GalaxyTrail game)
- Anything on the Nintendo Switch

I'm even working on my own clone! https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge

I also have a Discord server! https://discord.gg/mteMJw4

My dev partners:
