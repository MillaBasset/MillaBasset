# Hello! I'm Milla. Welcome to my GitHub page.

## About Me

I am a 21 year old undergraduate and part-time developer born on April 30th.  
I am a Computer Science and Math dual major, with a general focus in the areas of:

- Cybersecurity
- Game development
- General utility and tool design

As for games, I play literally anything, for any console, including PC. However, I have a list of favorites:

- Tetris and other block stackers
- 4-key rhythm games (usually Etterna)
- Freedom Planet (and any other GalaxyTrail game)
- Anything on the Nintendo Switch

If you want to reach me, I'm usually available to chat on Discord (millabasset).

## P.S.A.

Please do not attempt to contact me about my past projects if they are not visible on this profile.

## Thanks for visiting my page! Stay tuned for new things from me in the future.
