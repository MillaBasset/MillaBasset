## Hello! I'm SashLilac, a.k.a. TS3 / Milla.

But enough of that...

## About Me

I just love cybersecurity. I'm 16, and trying to major in it.

Feel free to use any pronouns for me! I have no preference, people have referred to me in a variety of different ways.

As for games, I play literally anything, for any console, including PC. However, I have a list of favorites:

- Tetris (including official games and clones)
- Freedom Planet (and any other GalaxyTrail game)
- Anything on the Nintendo Switch

Contact me at TS3#7746 on Discord.
