# Hello! I'm Milla. Welcome to my GitHub page.

## About Me

I am a 20 year old student at the University of Maryland - College Park, born on April 30th.  
I am a Computer Science and Math dual major, with a general focus in the areas of:

- Cybersecurity
- Game development
- General utility and tool design

As for games, I play literally anything, for any console, including PC. However, I have a list of favorites:

- Tetris and other block stackers
- 4-key rhythm games (usually Etterna)
- Freedom Planet (and any other GalaxyTrail game)
- Anything on the Nintendo Switch

If you want to reach me, I'm usually available to chat on Discord (millabasset).

## Where is Cambridge?

I am no longer the maintainer of Cambridge due to rather extreme burnout and various other factors.  
There are other maintainers out there who have picked the project up in my stead. Here is a list of those I am aware of:

- A group of former contributors has created an organization dedicated to the game, located [here](https://github.com/cambridge-stacker). To my knowledge, this is where ongoing development of the game and modpack are taking place.
- A user by the name of Tetro48 has created their own [fork](https://github.com/Tetro48/cambridge) of the original engine, adding many new features that the original lacks. However, it is quite unstable and generally targeted towards more technically knowledgeable players.

Please keep in mind that these continuations are not affiliated with me and as such I cannot provide support with anything pertaining to them. You should direct all questions and requests for support to the maintainers of these projects.

### To Employers

I still believe the project is an excellent representation of my skills. If you would like to request my copy, please send me an e-mail.

## Thanks for visiting my page! There will be more to come soon...
